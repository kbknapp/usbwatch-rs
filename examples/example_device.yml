# Multiple devices can be listed in a single file
devices:
  # A device starts with a `name`
  #
  # The `name` is a human friendly way to reference in rule files
  - name: 'Sandisk Cruzer'
    # All below properties are defined by udev and can be found by using the
    # `usbwatch listen --objects=devices --format=yaml` command and
    # adding/removing the desired device
    #
    # All properties are optional, and are logical AND (i.e. all properties must
    # match exactly to trigger device match). The more specific, the less likely a
    # similar device will trigger a match.
    #
    # Not being specific enough, can trigger a rule when a similar device is
    # detected (i.e. just specifying `ID_VENDOR: SanDisk` will trigger on all
    # SanDisk devices)
